# Shaggy's Adventures
This is an adventure rpg game. The player will act as character Shaggy and fight a total of three bosses on a pre-designtated route. The player can only move forward and only press "continue" to advance to the next scene, screen, boss, etc. The player will be able to pick up items (health potions, stamina potions, scooby snacks, etc.) to help them in the game. The game will take around 20 minutes to complete, but the player can prestige and play again with another character (ie. Scooby).
